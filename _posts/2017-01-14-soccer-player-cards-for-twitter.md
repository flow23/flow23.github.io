Many soccer player have played for less money for different clubs which they do today, obviously.
Some of the have risen to be a legend at their club nowadays. I posted some of them on twitter
and mentioned the players and/or the clubs twitter account. I also included their market value according to [transfermarkt](http://www.transfermarkt.de) at the time to the card as well. Enjoy!
